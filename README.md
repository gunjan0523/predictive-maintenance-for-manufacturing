🛠 Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing (Excel-Based Analysis)

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Predictive Maintenance—the process of forecasting when manufacturing machinery is likely to fail, using sensor data, to avoid costly unplanned downtime.

✅ Goal:
To analyze sample sensor data (such as vibration and temperature readings) and identify patterns that could indicate potential machine failure.

✅ Tools Used:

Microsoft Excel (for data analysis, visualization, and basic forecasting)

📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of simulated or real-world machinery sensor readings, including:

Vibration levels

Temperature values

Operational status over time




🔍 Key Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning:

Removed missing or incorrect values.

Standardized units where necessary.



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized trends using line charts.

Calculated summary statistics (mean, max, min, standard deviation).



3. Basic Forecasting (Optional):

Applied moving average trends to forecast potential failure points.



4. Visualization:

Created dashboards to easily monitor sensor behavior and spot anomalies.
